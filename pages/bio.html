                Hi there, I am Trav-Xeno, <br/>
                Learning about new technologies, programming, languages, and doing research is some of my hobbies. I know it's a bit nerdy, but its true. <br />
                I stay active doing all manner actives from swimming, skating, hiking, and running. 
                I loves dogs and cats.
                currently I have a six year old golden named Mathis.
                He loves the snow and travels. 
                You will not meet a better behaved dog, unless you see him in hyper mode. 
                <br /> <br />

            <p class="txt-center"> Generally speaking I am quite a curious one. I like learning about some new JS frameworks, web frameworks, new databases, and learning about different parts of programming languages.
                I like dabbling in technology and these are some of those technologies I have checked or would come back too if I could.
