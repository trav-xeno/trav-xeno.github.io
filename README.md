personal website this will get updated using react, or svelte in the future.

### Tufts HW additions
  * All parts complete and maybe went a little over board for the assignemnt, but I did learn a ton
  * discussed with no one: I did use W3Cschool.com and MDN docs to help look up CSS docs. in the case of w3cschool I used their CSS try it part as a way to expiemnt quickly without messin gwith the code I already wrote.
  * hours spent: 8 hours (lots and lots of css tweaks)

## future plans

- use front end tech svelte/react/vue3
- more fancy css or add tailwind css 
- Add some more interactive parts with css or Js 
- JS/TS game with pixi 
- minor js ML example fomr scratch using tensorflow.js
- WASM examples using rust/Grain
